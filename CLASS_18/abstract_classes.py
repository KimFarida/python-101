'''
An Abstract class is a class that contains one or more abstract methods.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.

Abstract classes can only be used via inheritance and their concrete child classes have to provide an implementation 
for all the abstract methods.

A class that inherits an abstract class and implements all its abstract methods is called a concrete class

A child class of an abstract class can be instantiated only if it overrides all the abstract methods in the parent class.

The term override in Python inheritance indicates that a child class implements a method with the same name as a method implemented in its parent class. This is a basic concept in object-oriented programming.
