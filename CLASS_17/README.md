PURPOSE OF ABSTRACT CLASSES
Abstract classes in Python are used to define a common interface for a group of subclasses. 
They enforce certain methods to be implemented by any subclass, ensuring a consistent API and encouraging code reuse. Abstract classes themselves cannot be instantiated and are meant to be inherited by other classes that provide concrete implementations of the abstract methods.
