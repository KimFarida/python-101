Create a function called 'matrix_operations' that:
1. Takes two matrices (lists of lists) as input
2. Returns:
   - The sum of the matrices
   - The transpose of the first matrix
   - The diagonal elements of both matrices

Example:
matrix_operations([[1,2], [3,4]], [[5,6], [7,8]])
[
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]

[
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8]
