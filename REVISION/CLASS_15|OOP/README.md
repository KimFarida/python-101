### Common Pitfalls to Address

- Forgetting self in methods
- Not understanding instance vs class attributes
- Modifying shared lists/dictionaries
- Confusing methods with functions
- Not initializing attributes in `__init__`


### Key Points for Students

- A class is a blueprint (cookie cutter, factory, template)
- Objects are instances (actual cookies, products)
- `self` refers to the specific object being used
- Each object has its own set of attributes
- Methods are functions that belong to the class

### Assessment Questions

- What's the difference between a class and an object?
- Why do we need the `self` parameter?
- What happens if we change an attribute in one object?
- When should we use a class instead of a function?
- How do we create multiple objects from the same class?
